# TIC-TAC-TOE

This is a two player tic-tac-toe game. Player 1 is identified as "X" and player 2 is identified as "O". The game alternately takes input from each player by asking the player to choose a number from 1-9 which represent each position on the tic-tac-toe board. The program continuously takes input from the players until a winner is detected or there's a tie, and prints the result in the end.
